### A Little Conversation 💬💑
- **Jake (BF):** Babe, I need your brain for a sec. I’ve got this problem, and it’s kind of like us… but in array form. 🤔
- **Emily (GF):** Oh, here we go again. What is it this time, another one of your weird math puzzles? 😅
- **Jake:** Yeah, kinda. So imagine we have this array of numbers, okay? And there's this number "k" that we *really* need to surpass. But the twist? We can only do it by combining the two smallest numbers in the array. 🧐
- **Emily:** So you’re telling me, we’re taking the smallest problems in life and squishing them together to get something better? 🙄
- **Jake:** Exactly! You take the two smallest numbers, say *x* and *y*. Then you combine them like a superhero duo: *min(x, y)* * 2 + *max(x, y)*. That’s your new number. You throw that number back into the array, and you keep going until everything’s greater than or equal to *k*.  
- **Emily:** Wait, so it’s like... playing a game of "who’s the weakest link?" and then making them stronger with their own powers? 😆
- **Jake:** Yeah! But here's the catch: we can only do this operation if we have at least two numbers in the array, so if we're running out of pairs, we’re stuck. 
- **Emily:** I can feel the pressure already… So, we just keep doing this until all the numbers are *super strong*? How many times do we have to do this, though? I need an operation count!
- **Jake:** That's the tricky part! We gotta figure out the minimum number of operations. We don’t want to waste time combining numbers that *almost* hit the target. 😤
- **Emily:** Got it. So this is like our relationship: taking the smallest things, combining them, and making them better... but we can't do it forever, or we’ll run out of stuff to combine. 💔
- **Jake:** Exactly! But hey, I trust you can solve this problem *together*, right? 😏
- **Emily:** Ugh, you're lucky I'm good at handling *k*—I’ll help you with the operations, but you owe me ice cream after. 🍦
- **Jake:** Deal!

### Problem Context 📝
You're given a list of numbers, `nums`, and a target value `k`.

In each operation, you’ll do the following:
1. Pick the two smallest numbers in `nums`.
2. Remove those two numbers from `nums`.
3. Add a new number: `min(x, y) * 2 + max(x, y)` to the list, where x and y are the numbers you picked.

You can repeat this process until **all the numbers** in `nums` are **greater than or equal** to `k`.

**Goal 🎯:**
Find the **minimum number of operations** needed to make all numbers in `nums` greater than or equal to `k`.

**Input**:
- A list of integers, `nums`, where each integer is a number in the array.
- An integer, `k`, the target value.
**Output:**
- The **minimum number of operations** required to make every number in nums **greater than or equal** to `k`.

### Examples 🧮🎮

- **Example 1:** <br>
**Input:** `nums = [2, 11, 10, 1, 3]`, `k = 10` <br>
**Output:** `2` <br>
**Explanation:** <br>
    - **Round 1:**  
    We start by grabbing the **weakest players** in the game: **1** and **2**.  
    They team up and combine their powers to form a **new hero**:  
    `1 * 2 + 2 = 4`  
    Now the team looks like this: `[4, 11, 10, 3]`.  
    Not quite there yet, but hey, we’re making progress! 🏃‍♀️💨 <br>
    - **Round 2:**  
    Now, we pick the next weakest duo: **3** and **4**.  
    They join forces and magically transform into:  
    `3 * 2 + 4 = 10`  
    And voilà, the team is looking strong: `[10, 11, 10]`. 💥💪  

    Mission accomplished! 🎯 And just like that, in only **2 operations** (we’re basically math ninjas 🥷), everyone is now strong enough to meet the target **k**. Who knew **math** could be this fun and action-packed? 🎮🔥

- **Example 2:** <br>
**Input:** `nums = [1, 1, 2, 4, 9]`, `k = 20` <br>
**Output:** 4 <br>
**Explanation:** 
    - **Round 1:**  
    We grab the **two weakest players**: **1** and **1**.  
    They join forces and become:  
    `1 * 2 + 1 = 3`  
    Now, the team looks like this: `[2, 4, 9, 3]`.  
    Progress, but not quite there yet! 🏃‍♂️💨
    - **Round 2:**  
    Next up, we pick the **weakest duo**: **2** and **3**.  
    They combine their powers and form:  
    `2 * 2 + 3 = 7`  
    Now the team is: `[7, 4, 9]`. 💪  
    Still not at **k**, but we’re getting stronger! 🔥
    - **Round 3:**  
    We continue the grind and pick the next weakest pair: **4** and **7**.  
    They combine to form:  
    `4 * 2 + 7 = 15`  
    The team now looks like: `[15, 9]`. ⚡  
    We're so close now!
    - **Round 4:**  
    Finally, we take **9** and **15** and combine their powers to make:  
    `9 * 2 + 15 = 33`  
    Boom! The team is now: `[33]`. 💥  
    And guess what? Everyone is now **greater than 20**! 🎉

    So, after **4 operations**, we’ve reached the goal! Mission complete! 🎮💯 <br>
    Who knew math could be this much of an adventure? 🏆🎉

### Constraints ⚖️
Alright, before you dive into this challenge, here’s what you need to know:

1. **The Array**:  
   Your list, **nums**, will have at least **2 elements** but no more than **200,000 elements**.  
   So, no matter how big the team gets, it’s still manageable. 😉  
   <code>2 <= nums.length <= 2 * 10<sup>5</sup></code>

2. **Array Elements**:  
   Each number in the array will be **between 1 and 1 billion**.  
   So, yes, your numbers could be HUGE, but don't worry! You're totally up for the task. 💪  
   <code>1 <= nums[i] <= 10<sup>9</sup></code>

3. **The Magic Target (k)**:  
   The target value **k** will also be **between 1 and 1 billion**.  
   You need to get all your numbers in **nums** to meet or exceed this magical number. ✨  
   <code>1 <= k <= 10<sup>9</sup></code>

4. **And guess what?**  
   The input is always designed in a way that you’ll eventually reach your goal! 🏆 That means there’s no way to get stuck. No stress! 😎  
   *An answer always exists, so go ahead and combine those numbers!*

### Hints 🧐
- Use a priority queue to always know who the weakest players are.  
- Keep combining the weakest two until everyone is strong enough to meet the target **k**! 🚀
