### 🤔 Intuition
The problem is all about taking the two smallest numbers in an array, combining them into a new number using a special formula, and repeating this process until all numbers are larger than or equal to the threshold, `k`.  
It’s like two weaklings teaming up to form a stronger superhero 💥! We keep doing this until every number is strong enough to meet the target. Simple, right? 😎

### 🧠 Approach
1. **Pick the smallest two numbers**: Using a data structure like a **SortedList** (Python) or a **min-heap** (C++), we always grab the two smallest numbers.
2. **Combine them**: We create a new number from the formula: `min(x, y) * 2 + max(x, y)` where `x` and `y` are the two smallest numbers.  
   It’s like giving them a magic power-up 🦸‍♀️🦸‍♂️!
3. **Add the new number**: The newly formed number is pushed back into the list (or heap), and the process repeats until all numbers are larger than or equal to `k`. 
4. **Stop when done**: Once all numbers are ≥ `k`, we count how many operations we performed 🎯.

### ⏱ Time Complexity
- **Python (SortedList)**:  
  Inserting or removing an element from a `SortedList` is **$O(log(n))$**, and since we perform this operation repeatedly, the time complexity will be **$O(n \times log(n))$**, where **$n$** is the length of the array.  
  Just like sorting a huge stack of paperwork, it takes a bit of time but gets the job done! 📚

- **C++ (Min Heap)**:  
  Each operation on a min-heap (push and pop) takes **$O(log(n))$** time, and we perform this operation for every pair of elements in the list.  
  So, the time complexity is also **$O(n \times log(n))$**. Think of it as managing a priority list of tasks with deadlines! 📅

### 💾 Space Complexity
- **Python (SortedList)**:  
  We need space for storing the `SortedList`, so the space complexity is **$O(n)$**, where **$n$** is the number of elements in the list.  
  It's like keeping a tidy list of your favorite books 📚 (space for each one).

- **C++ (Min Heap)**:  
  The min-heap stores all the numbers, so the space complexity is **$O(n)$** as well. Just like having a bookshelf for your entire collection! 📚🏰

### 💻 Code Implementation
- **Python**
    ```python3 []
    class Solution:
        def minOperations(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
            # Starting the operation count at 0 (because we haven't done any magic yet!) 🧙‍♂️✨
            min_Operations_To_Reach_Threshold = 0
            
            # Using SortedList to always keep the smallest numbers in order (think of it like a priority queue but fancier 💅)
            heap = SortedList(nums)

            # Grab the first two smallest numbers to start the fun! 🎉
            x, y = heap.pop(0), heap.pop(0)

            # We keep going until we reach the goal of 'k'! 🚀
            while x < k:
                # Add 1 to the operation count because we’re about to combine some numbers! 🤝
                min_Operations_To_Reach_Threshold += 1
                
                # Perform the magic operation: min(x, y) * 2 + max(x, y) (just like an alchemist's recipe!) 🧪
                value = min(x, y) * 2 + max(x, y)
                
                # Add the newly created "superpower" back into the list 💥
                heap.add(value)
                
                # Time for the next two smallest numbers to step up and join the party! 🎊
                x = heap.pop(0)

                # If the heap is empty, break out of the loop! We're done here 👋
                if not heap: break
                
                # Grab the next number to combine with 'x' (it's like a dance partner shuffle 💃🕺)
                y = heap.pop(0)

            # Return the total number of operations we did to reach the goal 🎯
            return min_Operations_To_Reach_Threshold
    ```
- **C++**
    ```cpp []
    class Solution {
        public:
            int minOperations(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
                // Keep track of how many operations we've done so far (let's call it our operation 'score'! 🏅)
                int min_Operations_To_Reach_Threshold = 0;
        
                // Use a priority queue to always pick the smallest two numbers (like a priority list, but with a heap! 🏰)
                priority_queue<long, vector<long>, greater<long>> heap;
        
                // Push all numbers from the array into the heap (they’re ready for their turn in the operation circus! 🎪)
                for(const int& num: nums) heap.push((long) num);
        
                // Time to grab the first two smallest numbers from the heap! Let's call them "x" and "y" 👫
                long x = heap.top(); heap.pop();
                long y = heap.top(); heap.pop();
        
                // While our smallest number is still less than 'k', we keep going! The operation continues! 💥
                while(x < k) {
                    // Count this operation as another success! 🏆
                    ++min_Operations_To_Reach_Threshold;
        
                    // Combine "x" and "y" with our special formula (it's like math magic! ✨)
                    long value = min(x, y) * 2 + max(x, y);
                    
                    // Push the new "supercharged" number back into the heap to keep the operation rolling 🔄
                    heap.push(value);
        
                    // Grab the new smallest number "x" (the dance continues 💃)
                    x = heap.top(); heap.pop();
        
                    // If the heap is empty, we can't continue, so we break out 🛑
                    if(heap.empty()) break;
        
                    // Grab the new second smallest number "y" for the next round 🎲
                    y = heap.top(); heap.pop();
                }
        
                // Return the total number of operations we had to do to reach the target! 🎯
                return min_Operations_To_Reach_Threshold;
            }
        };
